# Dart Null-Aware Operator Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the null-aware operator (???) in Dart.  The bug involves the unexpected use of a default value when a null value was expected to trigger different behavior. The solution showcases a more robust approach.

## Bug Description:
The `bug.dart` file contains a class `MyClass` that utilizes the null-aware operator to provide a default value of 0 if the `_myVariable` is null.  However, this default value might not be suitable in all scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect calculations if a null value is intended to signify a specific state or absence of a value.

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.dart` file presents an improved solution that handles null values more explicitly and appropriately. This ensures that the absence of a value is handled correctly, preventing unintended consequences.
